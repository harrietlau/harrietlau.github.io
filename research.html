     <h3>Tidal Tomography</h3>
    
    <p>The density field of the mantle is a key parameter in constraining the dynamics of mantle flow.
       We have set out to understand mantle density by appealing to a much-neglected geophysical 
       process, namely solid Earth tides. Predicting the deformation of the solid Earth in response to periodic luni-solar forcings 
       has a rich history in classical physics, with theoretical work dating back to Newton.  
       The advent of modern space geodetic methods (e.g., surveying using the Global Positioning 
       System) has yielded unprecedented constraints on solid Earth tidal deformation and revealed 
       geographical variations in body tide deformation at the sub-mm level.  These variations 
       are indicative of heterogeneity in mantle buoyancy and elastic structure. 
       <br><br>
	   Using a tidal theory we developed, we have shown
	   that the deepest parts of the mantle beneath African and the Pacific are characterized
	   by negative buoyancy.  Such a result holds implications
	   for the compositional distribution of the mantle, which in turn provides information
	   on the primordial state of the mantle, and its ongoing evolution and how
	   efficiently the mantle mixes.
	       This initial application shows the great promise of “tidal tomography” in elucidating 
	       deep mantle buoyancy structure and there are many directions to be taken (e.g., augmenting
	       data to include many types of tides, joint inversions with more conventional data,
	       further generalizing the theory to allow for more complicated processes).

    <h3>Mantle viscosity across frequency</h3>

    <p> The Earth is subject to forces with timescales that range from milliseconds to billions of years, and the 
      rheological response to these processes varies dramatically across this range: e.g., seismic waves 
      triggered by brittle failure of rocks along faults are a transient and largely elastic phenomenon.  
      In contrast, temperature differences of ~3000 K across the mantle have existed since the formation of Earth 
      4.5 billion years ago, driving a slow viscous convection that powers plate tectonics.  At intermediate 
      timescales of thousands to tens of thousands of years, the growth and disappearance of ice sheets over 
      ice age cycles have led to viscoelastic perturbations in Earth’s shape, gravitational field and rotation
      axis that involve a rapid, elastic component and a slow, viscous component that persists to the present day.  
      Yet all these processes transpire on the same Earth.

      That the Earth can respond in such disparate ways to different geological processes is well known, and
      it has become increasingly evident that the treatment of these processes in isolation 
      has led to a number of inconsistencies in our understanding of solid Earth structure and deformation. 
      Such inconsistency may indicate that the different processes are sampling fundamentally different
      regimes of viscous flow or they may reflect the wide range of geological settings in which these
      processes occur. Is it possible to resolve this inconsistency and develop a more generalized model
      of Earth rheology? Our aim is to try just that, and requires the ability to model many processes with
      sufficient rheological flexibility while accounting for the spatial and temporal range of
      disparate geological and experimental observations.

    <h3>Mantle viscosity across space</h3>

	      The 3-D elastic structure of the Earth was first revealed in the pioneering studies of seismic
	      tomography in the early 1980s. In the intervening decades the resolution of these early
	      images has improved considerably.
	      However, the current state of knowledge of the Earth’s interior is fundamentally incomplete
	      because 3-D variations in mantle viscosity, which likely reach several orders of magnitude,
	      remain largely unconstrained.
	      To improve this state of understanding, we are developing new theoretical and numerical techniques
	      (namely, Adjoint Methods) for the relevant geodynamical processes (e.g., mantle convection, glacial
	      isostatic adjustment) with the intention of making the modeling of these processes more computationally
	      feasible.  This effort is being led by collaborators at Cambridge University (Ophelia Crawford,
	      David Al-Attar, and Jacky Austermann) and these new techniques have the promise to provide a
	      tractable means to analyze mantle viscosity with an unprecedented level of quantitative analysis.
	      The long term goal is to produce the first ever map of 3-D variations in viscosity which will
	      provide extraordinary insight into the physical and chemical state of the Earth’s mantle.

	    <p>
	      Planetary science has recently received much attention with new discoveries emerging from missions
	      within our solar system (e.g., Curiosity, JUNO) or beyond (e.g., Kepler). These discoveries challenge
	      entrenched views on planetary evolution and structure given the extreme parameter space in which
	      planets and exoplanets exist. With ongoing and upcoming missions (e.g., GRAIL, Insight), tidal
	      observations have the potential to provide significant constraints on planetary structure.
	      <br><br>
		  A natural extension of the work described above will be to generalize the theoretical tidal framework
		  to accommodate arbitrary planetary structure (e.g., planets with purely solid cores like Mercury
		  or extensive subsurface lakes like Europa). In many cases, tidal dissipation can be the
		  dominant source of heat on other planetary bodies (e.g., the inner Jovian moons) and tidal measurements
		  are the only constraints available on the density, elastic and viscous structure of planetary bodies.
		  Exploiting such information can deepen our understanding of the body’s current and past thermal state.
		  With more accurate tidal data becoming available from the GRAIL and (soon) Insight missions,
		  generalizing and applying the theoretical and numerical methods developed will provide a timely research target.

		  </div>

		      <p> The overarching goal of the research themes listed above is to improve our understanding of how
			the solid Earth deforms over many spatial and temporal scales.  If this is sucessful, such work
			will open up new collaborative opportunities that straddle multiple fields, combining mantle flow
			simulations with long term variations in geochemical cycles, atmospheric evolution, paleo and
			modern climate studies.  
			<br><br>
			    Examples include: understanding the present day mass balance of Antarctic ice sheet loss by
			    incorporating the latest ideas of ice melt coupled with complex subsurface structure;
			    exploring whether the possible periodicity of large-scale volcanism over millions of years
			    reflects characteristic time scales in the mantle and the implications this holds for
			    extinctions recorded in paleontological fossil records; how changes in Earth's rotation rate
			    and continental configuration might affect tidal dissipation through time; how solid Earth
			    deformation can help date the Black Sea flood (attributed to be the flood associated with
			    Noah's ark).
